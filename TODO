* PIDs of daemon and its supervise process
* memory consumption, CPU load
* write a Readme.md file
* test deploy - currently does not work that smoothly

* log files
  - ability to clear log files
  - ability to scroll without fetching the entire file to prevent overload (ajax fetch offset, limit)
  - add edit config view to set log file location(s)
  - how to clear a log file while another process writes to that file ?
